# django-password-generator
A basic website that generates a password using very simple logic.


The idea and the ui implementation for this comes from a tutorial series from [zappycode](https://github.com/zappycode/django3-password-generator)
The logic to generate the password was written by me and differs slightly from the implementation in the tutorial.

## Running the project

To run the web app, make sure `you have django installed` ( I did not setup a virtual env for this project ).

- Run `python manage.py runserver` in the root directory.
- Navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser of choice.
